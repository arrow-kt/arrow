### It's all about morphisms
 
[@uberto](https://github.com/uberto) gives a gentle introduction to Category Theory for programmers used to OOP but interested in Functional Programming. No Haskell knowledge required. We will explain main concepts behind functional programming with many diagrams and simple metaphors and examples. Some code will clarify how to translate these ideas in programs.

### Introduction to Kotlin Arrow by Jacob Bass

[@bassjacob](https://github.com/bassjacob) goes through how Funktionale and Kategory merged into Arrow, consolidating two of the most popular FP libraries in the Kotlin space into one powerhouse. The talk is an introduction to some FP concepts, how the libraries work, what features they bring to the table and where you might use them in your code.

### Functional Programming in Kotlin with Arrow by Emmanuel Nhan
[@nhanmanu](https://twitter.com/nhanmanu) introduces Kotlin and how it is a good fit for functional programming. The talk goes through some interesting features of Kotlin, then show how to use them to enter the world of Higher Kinds and Typeclasses. In the last part, we explore some Arrow capabilities & built-in syntax, using validation as an example.

### Higher Kinded Types in a Lower Kinded Language by Jacob Bass

It's hard coming back down to the earth of a JVM based language after spending time with Haskell and OCaml. This talk will discuss functional programming in Kotlin with the Arrow library, how the abstractions it provides can improve your code, and how this magic that provides higher-kinded types works under the hood.

### Optics and Type Classes in Arrow

[@msya](https://github.com/msya) explains how to use various optics and type classes in Arrow. He discusses optics such as 
[`Lens`]({{ '/docs/optics/lens' | relative_url }}) and [`Iso`]({{ '/docs/optics/iso' | relative_url }}). He also goes over the purpose for type classes and how [KEEP-87](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/pull/87) will make it easier to implement them.
