[@bassjacob](https://github.com/bassjacob) goes through how Funktionale and Kategory merged into Arrow, consolidating two of the most popular FP libraries in the Kotlin space into one powerhouse. The talk is an introduction to some FP concepts, how the libraries work, what features they bring to the table and where you might use them in your code.
