/**
 * Ktor [ApplicationEngine] as a [Resource]. This [Resource] will gracefully shut down the server
 * When we need to shut down a Ktor service we need to properly take into account a _grace_ period
 * where we still handle requests instead of immediately cancelling any in-flight requests.
 *
 * @param factory Application engine for processing the requests
 * @param port Server listening port. Default is set to 80
 * @param host Host address. Default is set to "0.0.0.0"
 * @param watchPaths specifies path substrings that will be watched for automatic reloading
 * @param preWait preWait a duration to wait before beginning the stop process. During this time,
 *   requests will continue to be accepted. This setting is useful to allow time for the container
 *   to be removed from the load balancer. This is disabled when `io.ktor.development=true`.
 * @param grace grace a duration during which already inflight requests are allowed to continue
 *   before the shutdown process begins.
 * @param timeout timeout a duration after which the server will be forcibly shutdown.
 * @param module Represents configured and running web application, capable of handling requests.
