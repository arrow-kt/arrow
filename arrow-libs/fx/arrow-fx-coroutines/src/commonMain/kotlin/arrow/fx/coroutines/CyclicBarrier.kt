/**
 * A [CyclicBarrier] is a synchronization mechanism that allows a set of coroutines to wait for each other
 * to reach a certain point before continuing execution.
 * It is called a "cyclic" barrier because it can be reused after all coroutines have reached the barrier and released.
 *
 * To use a CyclicBarrier, each coroutine must call the [await] method on the barrier object,
 * which will cause the coroutine to suspend until the required number of coroutines have reached the barrier.
 * Once all coroutines have reached the barrier they will _resume_ execution.
 *
 * Models the behavior of java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier in Kotlin with `suspend`.
 *
 * @param capacity The number of coroutines that must await until the barrier cycles and all are released.
 * @param barrierAction An optional runnable that will be executed when the barrier is cycled, but before releasing.
