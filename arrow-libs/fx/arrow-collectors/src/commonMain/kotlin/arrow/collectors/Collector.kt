/**
 * A [Collector] accumulates information from elements
 * coming from some data source, usually a [kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow] or [Iterable].
 *
 * The accumulation is done in three phases:
 * - Initialization of some (mutable) accumulator ([supply])
 * - Updating the accumulator with each value ([accumulate])
 * - Finalize the work, and extract the final result ([finish])
 *
 * This interface is heavily influenced by
 * Java's [`Collector`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collector.html)
 * and Haskell's [`foldl` library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foldl/docs/Control-Foldl.html).
