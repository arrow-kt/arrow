/**
 * A [CircuitBreaker] is used to `protect` resources or services from being overloaded
 * When a service is being overloaded, interacting with it more will only worsen its overloaded state.
 * Especially when combined with retry mechanisms such as [Schedule],
 * in some cases simply using a back-off retry policy might not be sufficient during peak traffics.
 *
 * To allow such overloaded resources from overloading, [CircuitBreaker] can help you `protect` the service by failing-fast.
 * Thus [CircuitBreaker] helps us to achieve stability and prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.
 *
 * [CircuitBreaker] has three [CircuitBreaker.State]:
 *  1. [Closed]: This is its normal state, where requests are being made. The state in which [CircuitBreaker] starts.
 *    - When an exception occurs it increments the failure counter
 *    - A successful request will reset the failure counter to zero
 *    - When the failure counter reaches the [maxFailures] threshold, the breaker is tripped into the [Open] state
 *
 *  2. [Open]: The [CircuitBreaker] will short-circuit/fail-fast all requests
 *    - All requests short-circuit/fail-fast with `ExecutionRejected`
 *    - If a request is made after the configured [resetTimeout] passes, the [CircuitBreaker] is tripped into the a [HalfOpen] state, allowing one request to go through as a test.
 *
 *  3. [HalfOpen]: The [CircuitBreaker] is in this state while it's allowing a request to go through, as a `test request`
 *    - All other requests made while `test request` is still running will short-circuit/fail-fast.
 *    - If the `test request` succeeds then the [CircuitBreaker] is tripped back into [Closed], with the resetTimeout and the failures count also reset to initial values.
 *    - If the `test request` fails, then the [CircuitBreaker] is tripped back into [Open], the [resetTimeout] is multiplied by the [exponentialBackoffFactor], up to the configured [maxResetTimeout].
 *
 * Let's say we'd want to create a [CircuitBreaker] that only allows us to call a remote service twice,
 * and then whenever more than two requests fail with an exception, the circuit breaker starts short-circuiting failing-fast.

 * <!--- KNIT example-circuitbreaker-01.kt -->
 *
 * A common pattern to make fault-tolerant/resilient systems is to compose a [CircuitBreaker] with a backing-off policy retry Schedule to guarantee not overloading the resource and the client interacting with it.
 * but also not the client that is interacting with the resource.
 * Below you can see how the simple `retry` function will result in `Either.Left<CircuitBreaker.RejectedExecution>`,
 * but when we combine it with another schedule, it will always call the `CircuitBreaker` on times that it could've entered the [HalfOpen] state.
 * The reason why [Schedule] is not sufficient to make your system resilient is because you also have to take into account parallel calls to your functions,
 *; In contrast, a [CircuitBreaker] can track failures of every function call or even different functions to the same resource or service.
