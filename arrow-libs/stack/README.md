# BOM file

Thanks to [@ps-feng](https://github.com/ps-feng) for creating [#2129](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow/issues/2129) proposal.

BOM file is useful to include several dependencies without the specification of their versions.

## Use

```
dependencies {
    implementation platform("io.arrow-kt:arrow-stack:$ARROW_VERSION")

    // Versions are no longer required here
    implementation "io.arrow-kt:arrow-core"
    implementation "io.arrow-kt:arrow-fx"
    implementation "io.arrow-kt:arrow-mtl"
    ...
}
```
